# alpine-pentest-podman
Dockerfile, Build and Run script to build and run a lightweight container with nmap, proxychains and tor installed

I thought it will be useful for other people trying to do the same: Quickly firing up an environment and be ready to pentest :)

This tool buikld and runs a container with podman and offer you a terminal with installed proxychains, tor and nmap

Upcoming versions will give you the options to select to run the container with podman or docker and to use tor or proxys with proxychains.

You need podman installed (https://podman.io/getting-started/installation.html)

Run build-pod.sh to download the image and build the container. Caution by default its using the root user mode, if you want to use the container in rootless mode remove the sudo from the script.

Run run-pod.sh to start and run the container.
